Release Notes
=============

*pytools* 1.1
-------------

1.1.3
~~~~~

- FIX: comparing two :class:`.InfixExpression` objects using method
  :meth:`~.Expression.eq_` would erroneously yield ``True`` if both expressions
  had the same operator but a different number of operands, and the operands of the
  shorter expression were equal to the operands at the start of the longer expression


1.1.2
~~~~~

- Catch up with fixes and pipeline updates introduced by pytools 1.0.3 and 1.0.4
- API: support inheriting class docstrings from superclasses using the
  :func:`.inheritdoc` decorator
- API: new :func:`.subsdoc` decorator to replace text in docstrings
- API: use background color for matrix grid in :class:`.MatrixMatplotStyle`


1.1.1
~~~~~

- API: :class:`.MatplotStyle` now uses PyPlot's current axes by default, instead of
  creating a new figure and axis


1.1.0
~~~~~

- API: :class:`.JobRunner` provides a new object-oriented interface to :mod:`joblib`,
  running instances of :class:`.Job` and :class:`.JobQueue` in parallel
- API: :class:`.AllTracker` detects and prohibits exporting objects imported from other
  modules
- API: :class:`.AllTracker` detects and prohibits exporting global constants (the
  preferred approach is to define constants inside classes as this provides better
  context, and will be properly documented via Sphinx)
